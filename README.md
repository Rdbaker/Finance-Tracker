Finance Tracker
===============

The finance tracker is a small web application which tracks different finances (groceries, eating out, housing, etc.) and allows the user to enter information into those trackers, saving the data. The different trackers are also saved. When viewing a tracker, a chart is displayed using the points that were previously saved.
This webapp uses [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) as an MVC framework and the [ChartJS](http://chartjs.devexpress.com/) library to render the graphs.
