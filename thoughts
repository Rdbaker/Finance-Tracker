it's starting to look like to properly do this I'll need to have some sort of database and not just a file system if I plan on 
putting this online at some point

it seems that AngularJS only reaches as far as data that's been given to it. If I want data to be handled by a database, I'll need
another way to handle it. Most likely Node with some small database like MongoDB or something small.

started wiring together a backend using Node, Express, Mongoose (MongoDB) and using modulus.io to host my database and application.
use 'modulus deply' to send the app to modulus.io when ready to deploy

3/24
I got rid of modulus and mongoose in favor of a file system stored on the server side. It may be slower, it may not be as practical, but it's free.
And it's teaching me how to construct and use an API of my own for accessing a stored file system
